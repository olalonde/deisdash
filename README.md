## Install

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/olalonde/deisdash.git
cd deisdash
# Create Deis app
deis create dash
# Configure app
## tells npm to install devDependencies (needed for build)
deis config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false
## tells our server to use the built files
deis config:set NODE_ENV=production
# Deploy app
git push deis
# Open Deis Dash in web browser
deis open
```

It was mainly tested on deis v1.12.2. If you find bugs with your version
of Deis, please report them through Github issues.

## Configure

Optional configuration:

To set the default deis controller (by default, deisdash tries to guess
it based on domain).

```
deis config:set \
  DEFAULT_CONTROLLER=https://deis.yourdomain.com \
  CONTROLLER_LOCKED=true
```

Some of those configurations will only take effect when the app is
rebuilt through a git push.

## Development

Deis Dash is a single page app written with React, Redux and Webpack. If
you want to contribute code, try to lint your code with eslint.

To start contributing, make sure you have Node >v5 installed.

```
npm install
# start development server
npm run start
```

## TODO

- Package as docker image with automated docker build?
